    <h1>Erectus PE5 Learning Unix</h1>
     <h2>What is Unix?</h2>
      <p>
        Unix is the name of an operating system used by most supercomputers and workstations today. This system was originally developed by AT&T and further expanded at Berkeley. 
        Several versions exist today with the same basic core of commands. For instance, Solaris is a version of Unix developed by Sun Microsystems (the company that also developed Java), 
        HP/UX is the name of the Unix version for Hewlett-Packard workstations, ULTRIX is the version used by Digital Equipment, Inc, and UNICOS runs on the Cray supercomputers.
      </p>
    
    <p>
      Beginning Unix users are often overwhelmed by the number of commands they must learn quickly in order to perform simple tasks. To assist such users, this Web page contains a sampling of 
      commonly-used Unix commands to allow you to perform some basic and necessary operations on most any Unix system.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you require more information about any of these (or other) Unix commands, then type man anyunixcommand where anyunixcommand is the command in question. The system should display 
      the on-line documentation for the anyunixcommand. Don't become concerned if some of these commands do not make sense to you; they should become more meaningful as you become more experienced 
      with the Unix environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong><i>Unix is a case-sensitive environment. Be sure not to use a capital letter in place of a lowercase letter; the results will not be what you expect. </i> 
    </p>

    <h3>Informative Commands</h3>
    <p>
    These commands provide information about your login, environment, terminal, machine, and system. They also allow you to make some changes to these states. These are listed in alphabetic order, 
      not in order of importance.

<H3>File Manipulation:</H3>
<DL>
<DD> A basic understanding of the Unix file system is required.  Unix
allows files in your <I>login</I> directory (the directory you exist in
when you successfully login to a Unix system);  Unix also permits the
creation of subdirectories to contain files. 
<P>
<DD>The Unix operating system uses a tree structure for storing files. The main
root of this tree (for the whole machine or system) is named <TT>/</TT>. 
Your main (or <I>home</I>) directory
can be addressed as <TT>&#126; </TT> or <TT>&#126;yourloginname </TT>.  The
home directory
of another user with login <TT>guy</TT> would be <TT>&#126;guy </TT>.  The
current directory (the one you
are working in at the current time) is referred to by a single dot
(<TT>.</TT>).  The parent directory (the
next one up the tree) is represented by two dots (<TT>..</TT>).
<P>
<DD> Now suppose your loginname
is <TT>stu</TT> and consider the following set of files:
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="UNIXfiles.gif">
</CENTER>
<P>
<DD> In the above structure, the subdirectories existing under the login
directory (<TT>&#126;stu </TT>) are shown; 
these subdirectories are named <TT>A</TT>,
<TT>B</TT>, <TT>C</TT>, <TT>V</TT>, <TT>W</TT>, <TT>X</TT>, <TT>Y</TT>,
and <TT>Z</TT>.  Note that <TT>A</TT>, <TT>B</TT>, and <TT>C</TT>
are subdirectories of <TT>&#126;stu </TT>.  Also note that 
	<UL>
	<LI><TT>V</TT> and <TT>W</TT> are subdirectories of <TT>A</TT>;
	<LI><TT>B</TT> has no subdirectories; 
	<LI>subdirectory <TT>C</TT> has subdirectories <TT>X</TT>,
		<TT>Y</TT>, and <TT>Z</TT>. 
	</UL>
Any number of files (or none at all) can exist in any subdirectory.
<P>
<DD>All file names in the following examples use capital letters, e.g.,
<TT>ABC</TT>.  Lowercase letters and digits could have been used as well;
for example, <TT>9dec91</TT> and <TT>afile</TT> are legal filenames. 
Remember that Unix distinguishes between upper and lower case;  <TT>XYZ</TT>
and <TT>xyz</TT> refer to different files.
