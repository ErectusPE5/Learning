     <h2>What is Unix?</h2>
      <p>
        Unix is the name of an operating system used by most supercomputers and workstations today. This system was originally developed by AT&T and further expanded at Berkeley. 
        Several versions exist today with the same basic core of commands. For instance, Solaris is a version of Unix developed by Sun Microsystems (the company that also developed Java), 
        HP/UX is the name of the Unix version for Hewlett-Packard workstations, ULTRIX is the version used by Digital Equipment, Inc, and UNICOS runs on the Cray supercomputers.

      Beginning Unix users are often overwhelmed by the number of commands they must learn quickly in order to perform simple tasks. To assist such users, this Web page contains a sampling of 
      commonly-used Unix commands to allow you to perform some basic and necessary operations on most any Unix system.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you require more information about any of these (or other) Unix commands, then type man anyunixcommand where anyunixcommand is the command in question. The system should display 
      the on-line documentation for the anyunixcommand. Don't become concerned if some of these commands do not make sense to you; they should become more meaningful as you become more experienced 
      with the Unix environment.

      <strong>NOTE:</strong><i>Unix is a case-sensitive environment. Be sure not to use a capital letter in place of a lowercase letter; the results will not be what you expect. </i>
